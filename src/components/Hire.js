                    I am able to handle multiple activities at the same time and can deal with a very fast pace
                    and complexity without getting flustered. I can make good decisions even when under
                    time pressure, uncertainty or stress. In my career, I have very high impact on others and
                    persuasive in expressing ideas. I can builds good working relationships with other groups
                    and functions. I always stay aware of new advances and looks for ways they can add
                    value to the business.
